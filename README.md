### Spook

Spook is aiming to be a light weight replacement for [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard). Please note that this is very early and almost doesn't work. Don't use it right now basically.

Building it should be as straightforward as:

```
make
```

After that you should have an executable called spook. It's known to build on Linux and Mac OS X.
