-- when a file is changed. "command" is a helper
-- for setting up what command to run. There is no
-- restriction on running shell commands however -
-- any function (in lua/moonscript) can be run

-- If a "command" isn't what you want to run, as mentioned, any function
-- can be run in response to a change. here's an example of how that might look:
-- {:round} = math
-- handle_file = (file) ->
--   f = assert io.open(file, 'r')
--   content = f\read!
--   f\close!
--   new_content = "do stuff do content: #{content}"
--   o = assert io.open('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'w')
--   o\write new_content
--   o\close!
--   true -- return true or false for notications
-- do_stuff = (file) ->
--   notify.start "do_stuff #{file}", file -- for terminal etc notifications
--   ts = gettimeofday! / 1000.0
--   success = handle_file file
--   te = gettimeofday! / 1000.0
--   elapsed = round te - ts, 3
--   notify.finish success, "do_stuff #{file}", file, elapsed -- for terminal etc notifications
-- 
-- watch "stuff", ->
--   on_changed "stuff/(.*)/(.*)%.txt", (a, b) -> do_stuff "stuff/#{a}/#{b}.txt"

-- Define additional notifiers to use. Any number of them can be specified here.
-- Set log_level to DEBUG to see whether there's a failure in loading them. Either
-- through command line switch -l or in this file.
notifier "#{os.getenv('HOME')}/.spook/notifier.moon"

-- You can even specify a notifier right here (perhaps for simpler variants), like:
--notifier {
--  start: (what, data) ->
--    print "#{what} "#{data}"
--  finish: (success, what, data, elapsed_time) ->
--    if success
--      print "Success! in #{elapsed_time} s"
--    else
--      print "Failure! in #{elapsed_time} s"
--}

-- Commands can be defined at top level too if more convenient, like:
-- cmd1 = command "ls -lah"

-- Yes commands can be defined with a placeholder for the file which
-- can come in handy. You may use <file>, [file] or {file} one or more
-- times. It is replaced with the path to the file given to the command
-- when running it - in such cases it's no longer added as the last input
-- to the command.
-- cmd2 = command "cat [file] | gzip -c > [file].gz"

-- and can be used wherever below inside a watch/on_changed statement.
-- watch "some_place", ->
--   on_changed "^some_place/(.*)/(.*).txt", (a, b) -> cmd1 "stuff/#{a}/#{b}_thing.txt"
--   on_changed "^other_place/(.*)/(.*).txt", (a, b) -> cmd2 "other_stuff/#{a}/#{b}_thing.txt"
